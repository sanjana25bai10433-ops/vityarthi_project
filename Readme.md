  Health Record Checker - python project
  This project is a simple health record checker developed in python.
  it helps users track basic health information such as BMI, Daily step counter, and activity level.
  The program collects user inputs like height, weight, and steps walked over multiple days.
  It calculates BMI, shows the health category, and finds the weekly average step count.
  This project helps beginners understand input handling, conditions, loops, and decision- making in python.
